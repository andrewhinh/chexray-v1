"There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Bilateral nodular opacities that most likely represent nipple shadows. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Clips project over the left lung, potentially within the breast. The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable. Chronic deformity of the posterior left sixth and seventh ribs are noted. IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.",Andrew3/physionet.org/files/mimic-cxr-jpg/2.0.0/files/p10/p10000032/s50414267/02aa804e-bde0afdd-112c0b34-7bc16630-4e384014.jpg,Andrew3/physionet.org/files/mimic-cxr-jpg/2.0.0/files/p10/p10000032/s50414267/174413ec-4ec4c1f7-34ea26b7-c5f994f8-79ef1962.jpg,PA,213014.53100000002,700395.0,14.0,30.0,53100000002.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,False
"The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Lungs are clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Multiple clips are again seen projecting over the left breast.  Remote left-sided rib fractures are also re- demonstrated.
